# Pathfinder Visualizer  
## Overview :  
This is an interesting and a fun project to do. The application is implemented in React and it visualizes several pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS and DFS and finds path as directed by respective algorithms from one point to another point on a board.
